#**Smell Examiner/Blaster**

**Background**
Smell blaster is a 3D interactive environment/ arcade shooter game. The main setting
is in a flower meadow with various types flowers (for just a line of plotted
flowers if it take too much time) that sway in the wind. The player floats
through this meadow and can examine the flowers, and can shrink down to examine
the scent molecules. At this size, the user floats through space and is bombarded
with floating scent molecules that they can examine or shoot at and neutralize the smell of.
They all have different colors that are associated with what they smell like
(-)-cis-rose oxide and beta caryophyllene for roses, and alpha-ionone and
beta-dihydroionone for violets. Everything will be rendered with the WebGL
library on Canvas and HTML5, maybe also using some blender models.
Inspired by the game in Magic School Bus episode 48, "Magic School Bus Makes a Stink".

**Functionality/MVP's**
- [ ] 3D models of smell molecules and flowers with display pages
- [ ] Camera is controlled by keypresses
- [ ] 3d molecules randomly generated and have floating physics
- [ ] Can shoot and destroy scent molecules with a laser apparatus

ind addition, the game with include:
- [ ] An intro sequence that will explain what is going on
- [ ] A production readme

**Wireframes**
The game will include a sidebar list of all molecules, and a toggle button that
switches between views

**Technologies**
This project will implement the following technologies:
- Blender models of flowers and meadowscape
- WebGL will handle animation, rendering, and game play logic. Molecule models also
done with WebGL
- Canvas for DOM rendering
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

Not quite sure about the file structure yet...?


**Implementation Timeline**

**Bonus Features**
honestly the flower section may end up being a bonus
