#**Runtao's 3D Game of Life**

**Background**
My Game of life is a 3D voxel painter and [Conway's Game of Life] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) simulation.



<!-- **Functionality/MVP's**
- [ ] 3D models of smell molecules and flowers with display pages
- [ ] Camera is controlled by keypresses
- [ ] Zoom is available
- [ ] ~Realistic~ animations

ind addition, the game with include:
- [ ] An intro sequence that will explain what is going on
- [ ] A production readme

**Wireframes**
The game will include a sidebar list of all molecules, and a toggle button that
switches between views

**Technologies**
This project will implement the following technologies:
- Blender models of flowers and meadowscape
- WebGL will handle animation, rendering, and game play logic.
- Canvas for DOM rendering
- Webpack to bundle and serve up the various scripts.

**Implementation Timeline**
Day 1: work on blender models and have all the node set up done
1. have canvas set up on page,
2. work out controls and flow of the game
3. familiarize self with WebGL
4. work on laser/shooting elements

Day 2: work on blender models and begin physics in WebGL
1. have test models for physics testing
2. continue work on control flow
3. set up camera and lasers

Day 3: Import blender models and link with WebGL
1. make sure the WebGL and blender models work
2. tweek the visuals and mood as needed

Day 4: style style style
1. have adequate styling of the home page
2. make sure controls work

**Bonus Features**
honestly the flower section may end up being a bonus but if there is time I
would work on adding sound features -->
